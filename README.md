# Hi, I'm Weixiang 👋

## About Me
I'm a postdoctoral fellow at Bishop's University studying **accretion onto supermassive black holes** using multi-wavelength, time-domain observations. My work focuses on understanding how these extreme environments evolve, vary, and interact with their surrounding galaxies. 

Beyond research, I enjoy developing **open-source tools** that support the broader scientific community, especially in astrophysics and data analysis. I’m also deeply interested in applying **modern machine learning methods to large and multi-modal datasets** --- bridging astrophysics and data science to uncover new insights.

## Astronomy Research Interests
- Time-domain/Multi-messenger astronomy
- Accretion disk physics and black holes, massive black hole formation and evolution
- Application of statistical and deep-learning techniques to astronomical data sets

## Machine Learning Interests
- Representation learning for multi-modal (time-series + imaging + spectrum + multi-wavelength photometry + ...) datasets
- Time-series analysis of irregularly-sampled data
- Uncertainty quantification
- Scalable data processing for large sky surveys
